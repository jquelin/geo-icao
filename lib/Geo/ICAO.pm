Return the one-letter ICAO C<$code> corresponding to C<$region>. If the
region does not exist, return undef.

Return the ICAO C<$region> corresponding to C<$code>. Note that C<$code>
can be a one-letter code (region), two-letters code (country) or a four-
letters code (airport): in either case, the region will be returned.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a major agency of
the United Nations, codifies the principles and techniques of
international air navigation and fosters the planning and development of
international air transport to ensure safe and orderly growth. Among the
standards defined by ICAO is an airport code system (not to be confused
with IATA airport codes), using 4-letter for this.

This module provides easy access to the list of airport ICAO codes, with
mapping of those codes with airport names, country and region codes.

Nothing is exported by default, but all the functions described below
are exportable: it's up to you to decide what you want to import. Export
is done with L<Sub::Exporter>, so you can play all kind of tricks.

Note that the keyword C<:all> will import everything, and each category
of function provides its own keyword. See below.


=head2 Regions

The first letter of an ICAO code refer to the region of the airport. The
region is quite loosely defined as per the ICAO. This set of functions
allow retrieval and digging of the regions.

Note: you can import all those functions with the C<:region> keyword.


=head2 Countries

The first two letters of an ICAO code refer to the country of the
airport. Once again, the rules are not really set in stone: some codes
are shared by more than one country, some countries are defined more
than once... and some countries (Canada, USA, Russia, Australia and
China) are even coded on only one letter - ie, the country is the same
as the region). This set of functions allow retrieval and digging of the
countries.

Note: you can import all those functions with the C<:country> keyword.


=head2 Airports

This set of functions allow retrieval and digging of the airports, which
are defined on 4 letters.

Note: you can import all those functions with the C<:airport> keyword.
